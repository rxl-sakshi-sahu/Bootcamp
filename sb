********** Notes of Navin Reddy- Telusko *********

Springboot uses the concept of single design pattern, i.e, the moment u start the application, it will give you the object.
book,spring doc

Beans
getBean, @Component bean will create an object for you
@Autowired - will search the obj by type in spring container
@Qualifier - searches obj by name

@Controller - handle all request
servelet - send request for something, map
@RequestMapping("Home") - whenever you get request a home, you execute the method written below it, something like public void Home()

Springboot dont need external servers,have less configurations
