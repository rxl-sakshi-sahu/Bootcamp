Beans
getBean will create a new object for you

@Component - will create object of only specified classes, (so that we wouldn't be using =new obj kinda thing)

-> By default spring uses the concept of Singleton(will get only one instance) design pattern, i.e., it will give you the obj even without calling getBean

-> but using Prototype, it will not create the obj, obj will be created only if you use getBean even if you use Component.
-> We can search an object by name also using  @Qualifier("laptop") // obj name let's say = laptop
whereas @Autowired searches by type

@Autowired - will search the  obj by type in spring container, which basically connects the object 
@Qualifier - searches obj by name

@Controller - handle all request
servelet - send request for something, map
@RequestMapping("Home") - whenever you get request a home, you execute the method written below it, something like public void Home()

Springboot dont need external servers,have less configurations
Springboot gives you a production ready application which you can deploy it on any server

 LET'S CREATE AN APPLICATION
 
 * Following MVC
 
 1) First create a controller and just like we do, declare a function within it, and also in spring, here we will use
 @Controller so that whenever ur browser will have the request, your controller will make sure to handle it well.
 @RequestMapping for mapping the url
 and just like render, here u can use 
 return "home.jsp";  ///it will return  home page content (like gsp)
 (!important  ---  but note that it will only return that page if you will include the dependency of let say tomcat jasper(same version as that of tomcat server),
 otherwise it will return a string simply i.e, home.jsp )
 
 eg- 
 
 *******************************
 
 inside HomeController.java
 
 //import packages
 
 @Controller
 public class HomeController
 {
 	@RequestMapping("home")
 	public String home()
 	{
 	System.out.println("hi");
 	return "home.jsp";
 	}
 }
 // inside home.jsp
 
 ..html
 <body> 
 Hello world
 </body>
