GARBAGE COLLECTION

Note-  the garbage collector tries to run only while the CPU is idle, to reduce the possible effect on the execution.
Garbage collection is performed automatically. We cannot force or prevent it.

Basic garbage collection algorithm is called “mark-and-sweep”.(refer- https://javascript.info/garbage-collection)

The following “garbage collection” steps are regularly performed:

1) The garbage collector takes roots and “marks” (remembers) them.
2) Then it visits and “marks” all references from them.
3) Then it visits marked objects and marks their references. All visited objects are remembered, so as not to visit the same object twice in the future.
4) …And so on until every reachable (from the roots) references are visited.
5) All objects except marked ones are removed.

DEEP AND SHALLOW COPY

Object.assign - shallow (copies object's reference)
structuredClone() - deep copy (don't affect original copy)

*************************************
Please note that methods sort, reverse and splice modify the array itself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
JS is single threaded and synchronous but....
Asynchronous can be achieved by ajax calls, setTimeout

jQuery has an option on Ajax calls to make them synchronously (with the async: false option).
The reason it's problematic is that this option will block all JavaScript on the page until it finishes, including all event handlers and timers.

						REACT (Library)
						
Higher Order Function - (Map, Reduce, Filter use in jsx)
HOF are those where we can pass function as parameter, or pass function inside function or return function.

Memory management-  agar scope/ closure se bahar gaya, koi object ne use point nhi kra hai to memory se kabhi bhi hat jaega kind of garbage collection.

First class functions -


DOM - html kyunki ek markup language h, initial design bna degi, par to change it dynamically we need third party, objects through which we can manipulate, here comes DOM
Browser converts the markup language to object model.

Hydration and Render- 
Server side jo bhi page bnta hai(hydration) client side ko (render) bolte hain, basically hydration is used in server side rendering.
render() - rendering the App component on the client side
						
Library vs framework - collection of libraries together forms framework

*********************************

React routing nhi kar skta, sirf rendering k kaam ata hai
For that we use React Router

*********************************

React akele render krne k capable nhi h, as its just a framework for virtual DOM.

VIRTUAL DOM, SHADOW DOM and ACTUAL DOM

Shadow DOM - (dom inside dom) bahar koi style change ki to uska effect andar wale dom pe nhi hoga and vice versa

Angular works on Actual DOM and React works on Virtual DOM. Both internally uses shadow DOM via CSS encapsulation.

React DOM fills the gap between Virtual and Actual DOM in react , kyunki changes will reflect in virtual dom only by react.
						
Ek synthetic component se multiple synthetic component return nhi ho skte 

Class based component  and Function based component
